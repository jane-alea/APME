# APME: the Alternative Protox Map Editor

## Important note
> APME is still in very early development. Don't expect much yet!

## What is this?
APME is a voxel editor for [Protox](https://protox.io/)'s map system. It does not, for now, attempt to fully replace the [official mapmaker](https://mapmaker.protox.io/), which has the distinctive feature of simulating the game's exact movement.

## What are the plans for APME?
This will be a modal editor; tools will include simple regular place/break, fill, paint bucket, extrude, move, wall generator and an area editor (this list is non-exhaustive!). It will also have a layer system and history.

## Is this official?
No. However, the Protox developers are aware of its existence.
